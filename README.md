v_0.1 pt.1 (16 Mar 2024): This is my ide/code editor that I have been working on for the past 3 and a half months and I have finaly pushed the code to github.
How ever it is not complete as i have only done the css part of the ide and not much of the javascript part.
It is made using html, css, jquery and built the app using electron, I was gonna use tauri becasue it's faster and costs less GB but I found it hard to work with kinda and also I am not advanced in rust so I had to use electron.
The instilation for the ide will be on my itch.io page just not right now, https://shizamdadev.itch.io/neride.
