This is my ide/code editor that I have been working on for the past 3 and a half months and I have finaly pushed the code to github.
How ever it is not complete as i have only done the css part of the ide adn not much of the jquery part.
It is made using html, css, jquery and built the app using electron, I was gonna use tauri becasue it's faster and costs less gb but I found it hard to work with kinda and also I am not advanced in rust so I had to use electron.
The instilation for the ide will be on my [itch.io]([url](https://shizamdadev.itch.io/neride)https://shizamdadev.itch.io/neride) page just not right now.
