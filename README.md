Hello, and welcome to my IDE. This is an IDE/code editor I have been working on for a good while now, and I am finally ready to show it to all of you. 
The IDE itself, like the theme, icons, and a bit more, is inspired by VS Code and Atom. The reason I chose to base my code editor around VS Code and Atom 
is because it looks cool, is easy on the eyes, and I was going for a nostalgic look for people who used to use Atom before it got shut down. :(
This editor is not really finished and won’t be, because it’s going to get updates to the code every so often, and then new versions of the app will follow.

Have a nice day! :)
