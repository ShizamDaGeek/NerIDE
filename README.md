Hello, and welcome to my IDE, this is a IDE/code editor I have been working on for a good while now and I am finally ready to show all you it.
The IDE itself liek the theme icons and a bit more is inspired by vscode and atom. The reason I choose to base my code editor around vscode
and atom, is because it looks cool nice on your eyes and I was going for a nostilga look for people who used to use atom befor it got shut down. :(
This editor is not really finished and wount, because it's gonna get updates to the code ever so often and then the version of the app coming 
afterwards.
